abstract = {Abstract Mobile and telecommunication networking uses temporary and random identifiers (IDs) to protect user privacy. For greater intelligence and security o the communications between the core network and the mobile user, we design and build a dynamic randomization scheme for the temporary IDs for mobile networking, including 5G and 6G. Our work for ID randomization (ID-RZ) advances the existing state-of-the-art ID re-allocation approach in 5G in the following ways. First, ID-RZ for ID updates is based on computing, as opposed to incurring networking for the re-allocation-based updates, and is designed for lightweight and low-latency mobile systems. Second, ID-RZ changes IDs proactively (as opposed to updating based on explicit networking event triggers) and provides stronger security (by increasing the randomness and frequency of ID updates). We build on the standard cryptographic primitives for security (e.g., hash) and implement our dynamic randomization scheme in the 5G networking protocol to validate its design purposes, which include time efficiency (two to four orders of magnitude quicker than the re-allocation approach) and appropriateness for mobile applications.},

abstract = {Despite the rapid growth of next-generation cellular networks, researchers and end-users today have limited visibility into the performance and problems of these networks. As LTE deployments move towards femto and pico cells, even operators struggle to fully understand the propagation and interference patterns affecting their service, particularly indoors. This paper introduces LTEye, the first open platform to monitor and analyze LTE radio performance at a fine temporal and spatial granularity. LTEye accesses the LTE PHY layer without requiring private user information or provider support. It provides deep insights into the PHY-layer protocols deployed in these networks. LTEye's analytics enable researchers and policy makers to uncover serious deficiencies in these networks due to inefficient spectrum utilization and inter-cell interference. In addition, LTEye extends synthetic aperture radar (SAR), widely used for radar and backscatter signals, to operate over cellular signals. This enables businesses and end-users to localize mobile users and capture the distribution of LTE performance across spatial locations in their facility. As a result, they can diagnose problems and better plan deployment of repeaters or femto cells. We implement LTEye on USRP software radios, and present empirical insights and analytics from multiple AT&amp;T and Verizon base stations in our locality.},

abstract = {Abstract Fifth Generation (5G) is the final generation in mobile communications, with minimum latency, high data throughput, and extra coverage. The 5G network must guarantee very good security and privacy levels for all users for these features. Therefore, researchers have deliberated the privacy and security solution of 5G users. The 5G wireless network offers a futuristic concept that helps to solve challenges affecting previous communications generations. The key concern to many scholars in the field of mobile networking is user privacy, which is long-term subscription identifier as International Mobiles Subscribers Identifiers (IMSIs) and short-term subscription identifier as Temporary Mobiles Subscribers Identifiers and Cell-Radio Networks Temporary Identifiers (TMSIs and C-RNTIs), which are used for permanent identifying, paging, and location update. This article investigates the existing literature survey about user privacy for 5G networks, which continues the identity and location privacy. Also, it discusses most of the studies that handle user identifications in authentication, paging, and location update. This article discusses the various privacy issues in the 5G network that use IMSI in clear text or temporary identities such as TMSI \& C-RNTI with IMSI to disclose user identity privacy. This article also investigates the existing literature on user identity and location privacy and highlights the key parameters, issues, challenges, and future recommendations with potential solutions.},

abstract = {In cellular networks, attacks on the communication link between a mobile device and the core network significantly impact privacy and availability. Up until now, fake base stations have been required to execute such attacks. Since they require a continuously high output power to attract victims, they are limited in range and can be easily detected both by operators and dedicated apps on users' smartphones.This paper introduces AdaptOver---a MITM attack system designed for cellular networks, specifically for LTE and 5G-NSA. AdaptOver allows an adversary to decode, overshadow (replace) and inject arbitrary messages over the air in either direction between the network and the mobile device. Using overshadowing, AdaptOver can cause a persistent (≥ 12h) DoS or a privacy leak by triggering a UE to transmit its persistent identifier (IMSI) in plain text. These attacks can be launched against all users within a cell or specifically target a victim based on its phone number.We implement AdaptOver using a software-defined radio and a low-cost amplification setup. We demonstrate the effects and practicality of the attacks on a live operational LTE and 5G-NSA network with a wide range of smartphones. Our experiments show that AdaptOver can launch an attack on a victim more than 3.8km away from the attacker. Given its practicability and efficiency, AdaptOver shows that existing countermeasures that are focused on fake base stations are no longer sufficient, marking a paradigm shift for designing security mechanisms in cellular networks.},

abstract = {We present several novel techniques to track (unassociated) mobile devices by abusing features of the Wi-Fi standard. This shows that using random MAC addresses, on its own, does not guarantee privacy. First, we show that information elements in probe requests can be used to fingerprint devices. We then combine these fingerprints with incremental sequence numbers, to create a tracking algorithm that does not rely on unique identifiers such as MAC addresses. Based on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our algorithm can correctly track as much as 50\% of devices for at least 20 minutes. We also show that commodity Wi-Fi devices use predictable scrambler seeds. These can be used to improve the performance of our tracking algorithm. Finally, we present two attacks that reveal the real MAC address of a device, even if MAC address randomization is used. In the first one, we create fake hotspots to induce clients to connect using their real MAC address. The second technique relies on the new 802.11u standard, commonly referred to as Hotspot 2.0, where we show that Linux and Windows send Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP) requests using their real MAC address.},

abstract = {MAC address randomization is a common privacy protection measure deployed in major operating systems today. It is used to prevent user-tracking with probe requests that are transmitted during IEEE 802.11 network scans. We present an attack to defeat MAC address randomization through observation of the timings of the network scans with an off-the-shelf Wi-Fi interface. This attack relies on a signature based on inter-frame arrival times of probe requests, which is used to group together frames coming from the same device although they use distinct MAC addresses. We propose several distance metrics based on timing and use them together with an incremental learning algorithm in order to group frames. We show that these signatures are consistent over time and can be used as a pseudo-identifier to track devices. Our framework is able to correctly group frames using different MAC addresses but belonging to the same device in up to 75\% of the cases. These results show that the timing of 802.11 probe frames can be abused to track individual devices and that address randomization alone is not always enough to protect users against tracking.},
